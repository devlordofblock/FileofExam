# FileofExam
FileofExam is a project that will enable assessment and evaluation institutions to publish the exam results of their examiners in the IPFS system. The reason for choosing IPFS as the infrastructure of this project is because it is a transparent and decentralized infrastructure, it increases the reliability of the exam result. Exam center will upload results from its own panel or via API. The examiner will also be able to see the result of this exam with the password shared with him. The exam result file will only be hosted in IPFS.
